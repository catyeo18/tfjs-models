    <h3>Context</h3>

      Convo is a voice-based system allowing users to develop computer programs by conversing in natural language with a conversational agent. For the user study, the system was designed to support both voice- and text-based conversations. Currently, the system supports three main tasks--(1) program creation, (2) program editing, and (3) system feedback--through natural language.
      
      Users interact with the system through the VUI. The VUI receives and transcribes voice input into text and sends it to the next module. The ASR is handled by Google's Cloud Speech-To-Text API service. The transcribed output is sent to a WebSocket server where the NLU and post-processing occurs, and the DM generates appropriate responses. Responses are voiced back to users using Google's Speech Synthesis API.
      
      The second module performs NLU on the input, extracting and recognizing users' intents based on utterances provided by the VUI. The NLU module is syntactically-constrained and uses a regex expression-based semantic parser to determine intent and extract semantic information.
      
      The third module is the DM, which is responsible for keeping track of the conversation, goals between users and the system, and the agent state. Agent states include program creation, editing and execution states, and are managed by a finite-state machine.
      
      Given information extracted by the NLU, the DM creates a "user goal." The goal contains the user's intent (e.g. intent to create a variable) and necessary actions the system must take to complete the goal. These actions are referred to as "agent goals." For example, when a user wants to create a variable, the DM will ask for a name and an initial value if they weren't originally provided by the user. In this case, the user goal is to create a variable, while the agent goals are to ask for the name and initial value. The latter behavior is commonly known as slot-filling. Completing agent goals leads to various possible changes, including state changes and new additions to the program. The agent goals and state determine the specific response Convo provides after a given user command.
      
      The fourth module is the program editor (PE), which is responsible for program-related tasks like editing and execution. The PE interacts with the DM, receiving program-related commands and actions and returning program context and state. During program creation, the editor keeps a program representation in memory. The representation is a list of actions that the agent performs when executing the program, and can be exported to other formats (e.g. JSON, Javascript, Python). During editing, the PE keeps track of the program state, which contains information such as defined variables and the current action.
